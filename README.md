## Overview

Medical computed tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in disease diagnosis, with CT technology having undergone significant evolution over the past half-century—from primary CT to energy-integrating detector CT, and now to photon-counting detector CT (PCCT) systems being deployed in clinical centers worldwide. Low back pain is a prevalent symptom affecting approximately 540 million people globally at any given time, with lumbar vertebral microstructure changes being a potential osseous factor contributing to this condition. However, these microstructural morphological changes remain largely undetectable due to current limitations in standard clinical CT equipment resolution.

This project addresses the critical need for algorithms capable of reconstructing high-resolution bone microstructure from paired regular clinical helical CT lumbar vertebral images to match the quality of state-of-the-art Micro-PCCT. The LumbarSR project provides a unique dataset of 30 paired human dry lumbar vertebrae scanned with both clinical helical CT (at multiple resolution and reconstruction configurations) and Micro-PCCT at 0.1mm super-resolution. This benchmark enables development and evaluation of super-resolution reconstruction algorithms in musculoskeletal imaging, with potential applications in osteoporosis screening, fracture risk assessment, and low back pain investigation.

The technical objective is to develop algorithms that can transform clinical helical CT images (0.5-1.0 mm resolution) into high-resolution images comparable to Micro-PCCT (0.1 mm), representing a 10-200× super-resolution enhancement factor. Success on this benchmark could transform routine lumbar CT scans into diagnostic tools for bone microstructure assessment, advancing AI-based image reconstruction in musculoskeletal radiology.

### Dataset Statistics

- **Training Set**: 30 samples, 212,805 slices total (avg 7,093.5 slices/case, registered to 105μm isotropic)

## Evaluation Metrics

### Image Quality Metrics

The following metrics are computed under **two CT window settings** (Bone, Soft Tissue) in **masked mode** (non-air region only):

- **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) - measured in dB, higher is better ↑
- **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index) - range [0, 1], higher is better ↑
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) - lower is better ↓

### Local Bone Contrast (LBC)

LBC is a microstructure-specific metric that measures the local intensity dynamic range within bone regions using a sliding window approach. It quantifies how well the super-resolution result preserves fine bone microstructure details (e.g., trabecular bone boundaries).

**Computation:**
1. A 16×16 pixel sliding window (stride 8) scans across bone mask regions (HU > -500)
2. Within each window, the percentile dynamic range P95 − P5 is computed
3. The mean dynamic range across all valid windows gives the LBC value (in HU)
4. **LBC Ratio** = Pred_LBC / GT_LBC (closer to 1.0 is better)

Higher LBC indicates sharper bone-air boundaries and better microstructure visibility. The LBC Ratio measures how much of the ground truth's local contrast is preserved by the super-resolution method.

### CT Window Settings

All image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, MAE) are computed under two CT window settings:

| Window | Window Center (WC) | Window Width (WW) | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Bone | 400 | 1800 | Bone structure visualization |
| Soft Tissue | 40 | 400 | Soft tissue visualization |

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

We recommend a standard local Python environment for training and evaluation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frankzhangrp/LumbarSR-Challenge.git
cd LumbarSR-Challenge

conda create -n lumbarsr python=3.10 -y
conda activate lumbarsr

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Environment checklist:
- PyTorch ≥ 2.0
- MONAI ≥ 1.2
- nibabel, pydicom, SimpleITK
- numpy, scipy, scikit-image

Optional checks:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
python -c "import monai; print(monai.__version__)"
python -c "import nibabel, pydicom, SimpleITK, scipy, skimage; print('deps ok')"
```

## Repository Contents

The public repository currently contains four main parts:

| Directory | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `baseline/` | Public | Rigid registration baseline based on ANTs, including `register_ants.py` and `batch_register.py` |
| `methods/` | Public | Interpolation, SRCNN, and UNet baselines with training and inference scripts |
| `evaluation/` | Public | Image quality evaluation scripts for PSNR, SSIM, MAE, and LBC |
| `docs/` | Public | GitHub Pages website, visualizations, and benchmark result pages |

The current release covers the registration baseline, super-resolution baselines, evaluation scripts, and the project website. ESRGAN, SwinIR, the dense close-set registration mask workflow, and the internal `trabecular_analysis` module are being prepared for a later public update.

## Registration Baseline and Mask Evaluation

The public repository already includes rigid registration code in [`baseline/register_ants.py`](baseline/register_ants.py) and [`baseline/batch_register.py`](baseline/batch_register.py).

### Current Public Evaluation Masks

- Public SR evaluation uses a non-air validity mask defined as `(gt > -1000) | (pred > -1000)`
- Public `LBC` uses a bone-region mask with threshold `HU > -500`

### Registration Evaluation

We report registration quality within a bone-mask ROI using `Dice`, `HD95`, and `HD`. These metrics are provided as a practical reference for the final registration quality.

| Method | ROI | Dice ↑ | HD95 ↓ | HD ↓ |
|--------|-----|--------|--------|------|
| ANTs rigid baseline | Bone mask ROI | To be added | To be added | To be added |

### Bone Morphometry

Our internal `trabecular_analysis` workflow computes bone morphometry measurements directly from CT volumes. The public benchmark pages reserve space for the following quantities:

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| Core trabecular morphometry | `BV/TV`, `Tb.Th`, `Tb.Sp`, `Tb.N` |
| Volume statistics | `BV (mm^3)`, `TV (mm^3)` |
| Topology | `Connected components`, `Euler number`, `Connectivity`, `Conn.D` |
| Structural complexity | `Fractal dimension`, `Principal-axis anisotropy` |
| Slice-wise summaries | `2D BV/TV mean`, `2D Tb.Th mean`, `2D Tb.Sp mean`, `2D Tb.N mean` |

Reserved result table:

- **UNet** excels at structural preservation with the highest SSIM scores
- All interpolation methods (Nearest) perform identically to baseline since input/output dimensions match
- **Masked evaluation** (focusing on anatomical regions) shows more discriminating metrics than full-image evaluation
- Deep learning methods show consistent improvements in both Small and Large FOV configurations

For detailed instructions, see [`methods/README.md`](methods/README.md).

### Reference Aggregate Summary

If a single summary number is needed for quick comparison, we use the following reference aggregation:

1. Compute one aggregate value per metric by averaging across all FOV and window combinations.
2. Order methods independently for `PSNR`, `SSIM`, `MAE`, and `LBC`.
3. Average the four per-metric orders to obtain a compact reference summary.

| Metric Category | Aggregate Score | Direction |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| PSNR Score | Mean of 4 PSNR values (2 windows × 2 FOV, masked) | ↑ Higher is better |
| SSIM Score | Mean of 4 SSIM values (2 windows × 2 FOV, masked) | ↑ Higher is better |
| MAE Score | Mean of 4 MAE values (2 windows × 2 FOV, masked) | ↓ Lower is better |
| LBC Score | Mean LBC Ratio across all input sequences | ↑ Closer to 1.0 is better |

**Reference aggregate = (PSNR_Order + SSIM_Order + MAE_Order + LBC_Order) / 4**

This summary is provided only as a convenient cross-metric overview. The per-metric results remain the primary basis for reporting and interpretation.
